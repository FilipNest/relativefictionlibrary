I could send it to the lab for processing. Get them to analyse vibrations in the picture, calculate around the missing information. But it never sounds as good as it should. I spend a lot of time in the library listening to field recordings but know I’ll run out eventually. Give it a year and it’s all we’ll ever have.\n\nI must have zoned out.

{"_id":"55f416f2d8e79e101900002a","author":"Chloe Aust","title":"The Dangers of Anthropomorphism","text":"The weather of late had been particularly... British. As spring made it's slow slump towards summer, it took a familiar, passive aggressive pattern of sunny spells during the working week and drizzle at weekends.\n\nEventually the first non-wet warm weekend arrived and was greeted with panicked joy as everyone rushed to the nearest outdoor space to bask in the balmy 17 degree heat.\n\nIt was in this spirit that Jane found herself in {{park}} searching for a space on the grass, which was completely obscured by a patchwork of picnic blankets.\n\nWandering along she spotted a notice board in the bushes near the gates. Some official looking council things that no-one ever read, a notice for some upcoming yoga classes, a lost dog. She looked at the picture of the missing pet with a pang of sympathy. As a child she'd had a dog herself: a mongrel, medium sized, a bit of terrier in it somewhere but mostly just reminiscent of a big ball of wire wool. When she was seven he'd got out the front door and was never seen or heard of again. She'd been heartbroken and her seven year old self swore off pet ownership forever.\n\nHowever, since breaking up with Dan a few months ago she had been thinking of reconsidering. The flat felt lonely. Even after all this time though, she still couldn't quite face another fluffy escape risk.\n\nTo the left of the lost dog sign was a bright yellow piece of paper with a poorly printed picture on it. Even though the image had come out badly from a battle with a near empty toner cartridge Jane thought its subject looked magnificent. Her eyes drifted to the words below: 'Snake For Sale'. She took note of the number.\n'I am a snake owner,' thought Jane. 'I am the sort of person who owns a snake. A really, really big snake.'\n\nOver the past week Jane had been accustoming herself to the new piece among the parts that make up Jane - snake ownership.\n\nThe serpent in question was called Doris. Who had named her Doris was a mystery. The man who sold Doris hadn't known a huge amount about her. The snake had belonged to a recently deceased relative who hadn't been the snake's first owner. That's all he knew, apart from the fact that Doris gave him the creeps.\n\nJane had wondered about the sale. Surely you shouldn't be able to sell a big snake, for cash via a flyer in a park? Surely there should be some kind of snake census?\n\nHowever, as soon as she saw Doris the deal was done. Doris was beautiful. More than five foot long and not done growing, her yellow green scales gave off a healthy gleam. Jane looked Doris in the eye and imagined she could see intellect as the snake stared back, her forked tongue delicately flicking in and out.\nA month later and Doris was settling in very well indeed. Initially Jane had mainly confined Doris to the sort of tank one expects to keep such a snake in. Reassured by Doris' former owner she let Doris out for short periods to explore her new abode - a reasonably sized two bedroom flat in {{park street}}. Over time Jane began to greatly enjoy the company of her new friend and Doris' time outside the tank increased.\n\nJane worked from home and spent a lot of time sat at her computer, which was set up in the flat's tiny second bedroom. The working from home life had begun with a 'laptop, sofa, film on' sort of set up but as time went on Jane resigned herself to the fact that having an actual desk away from the telly was much more conducive to productivity. She bought a proper computer and kept her desk surface tidy. Clean space, clear mind. (Ignoring the jumble of wires and plugs that were arranged underneath. Out of sight, out of mind.)\n\nOne morning, during Doris' early days as a resident of {{park street}}, Jane, with a jolt, felt something brush her ankle. Doris had escaped her tank. Jane, distracted by a looming deadline, assumed she hadn't shut it properly. Doris explored the space under the table, her forked tongue tasting the air and her angular head appearing to investigate all the corners before curling up near Jane's feet. Jane smiled at this almost loyal doglike gesture.\n\n'This is nice,' she thought, before returning to her work.\nOn the days Doris needed feeding Jane would eat her own breakfast first. She found getting Doris her dinner ruined her own appetite otherwise. After breakfast Jane would prop open the hatch to Doris' tank before going and getting settled at her desk. After a bit Doris would come and curl up at Jane's feet.\n\nEvery so often Jane would have to clean out Doris' tank, which was a bit of an arse, but that, the slightly macabre feeding time, and cleaning up the occasional snakeskin were the only downsides to Doris as far as Jane was concerned.\n\nOne day, mid-morning, Jane noticed that something felt wrong. Doris was nowhere to be seen. Turning in her chair she realised she had accidentally shut the door to the study behind her, shutting the snake out. Just as Jane rose from her chair she heard a click and the door swung open. The snake's top half landed on the floor with a thud.\n\nDoris could open doors.\n\nA quick Google search returned various videos of similarly massive snakes opening doors. Jane felt relieved to know that this wasn't an unheard of snake ability, while also disappointed at the thought that Doris could have become an online celebrity, had Jane only got in there first.\n'You're mad,' her brother Richard pronounced when he saw Jane's new {{park street}} flatmate. 'Raving'.\n\nOver a takeaway Jane explained to Richard the joys of snake ownership, they tested Doris' door opening abilities and discussed the downsides - namely Doris' dinnertime - before moving on to other subjects.\n\nFar too many glasses of wine later Jane saw Richard out, staggered to bed and passed out. At some point in the night Jane became aware of a slithering under the sheets. Doris stretched out alongside Jane, as if she was sleeping in the other half of the double bed. Too pissed to properly comprehend her snake's presence Jane simply passed out again.\n\nJane drifted slowly awake, her vision blurry and her head pounding. She sat up to get a drink of water and assess just how bad the hangover was when she spotted Doris stretched out on the other side of the bed. In her drunken state Jane had forgotten to shut her back in her tank the previous night.\n\nJane was strangely touched by her pet's desire to be near her at night though, before rushing to the toilet due to a wave of hangover induced nausea.\nAfter a few more late night escapes, each ending with Doris taking up the other side of the bed, Jane gave in and just allowed her companion the continual run of the flat.\n\nEach night, after Jane had gone to bed, she'd hear the sound of Doris smoothly making her way across the floorboards before entering under the duvet at the foot of the bed. Doris would make her way up to the top, poking her head out at the pillow end and stretch her full length straight down the bed.\n\nJane found the fact that Doris wanted to sleep next to her night after night charming, although she tried to remind herself that the snake probably just preferred the warmth under the covers.\nDoris drifted around the flat filled with anticipation. Finally her length comfortably surpassed the human's height.\n\nJane went to bed and the flat was in darkness. Working her way under the duvet Doris stretched herself out alongside the sleeping Jane one last time, just to check. Confident, Doris got into position and slowly began to open her huge jaw as wide as it would go.\n\nUncomfortably full, Doris moved to her favourite spot, under the desk curled over the warm plugs, while she waited for the digestion process to be complete. She calculated that she had a few days before anyone would notice Jane's disappearance. The human very rarely had visitors or even left the flat. When the too-full feeling had subsided and Doris felt up to moving again, she slithered out from under the desk, leaving a shed skin among the electrics. Doris moved slowly towards the front door and began to wait.\nRichard was surprised to find two policemen on his front step. They were, they explained, 'the bearers of bad news'.\n\nThere had been a fire at Jane's, completely gutting the flat and destroying everything inside. Firefighters were investigating the cause but as CCTV from the foyer of her building showed that she had been in the flat at the time, and all other residents had been accounted for, there was no doubt she had been killed.\n\nRichard reacted in the same way anyone would when finding out their only sibling had died in a fire. The police officers, used to delivering such information but still uncomfortable about it, reeled out the standard issue, supposedly comforting phrases.\n\nAfter a while the older officer cleared his throat. 'There is something we have to ask,' he said. 'It appears the deceased... Jane, I mean. Is it correct that Jane had a pet snake? A rather... large pet snake?'\n\nRichard looked up. 'Doris,' he said, in affirmation.\n\n'Well,' the officer said, seeming nervous, 'it appears the snake managed to escape the fire. Must have gotten out the front door, no idea how. Firefighters found it down the hall. Gave them quite a fright, unsurprisingly.'\n\n'Doris can open doors,' Richard offered in way of explanation. 'Does that answer your question?'\n\n'Well... no. Actually we were wondering if you could take it off our hands? Now.\n\n'As her closest next of kin and as the snake is the only thing to remain from the fire we thought it right that we pass it on to you. There are papers and formalities, of course, but we'd like you to have it sooner rather than later.\n\n'Gives us the creeps to be quite honest.'\nLater that evening, as Richard sat at a desk in his living room browsing the internet, he felt an unusual sensation. Doris had escaped her tank and was curling up by his feet.\n\nUneasy as he was about having the snake around, in some ways it was like having a piece of his sister still in his life. As Doris coiled near his feet Richard smiled at this almost loyal doglike gesture.\n\nDoris, meanwhile, was making a mental note of the layout of this new flat and its resident. She still had some growing to do.","editkey":"of Doris various length jaw","date":"1432944000","email":"\"\""}

Her head was cocked slightly as she scanned the {{city}} daily press; he noted a subtle movement in her throat as she swallowed. Once more he was transfixed, only vaguely aware of customers lining up at the bar of the {{pub}}, clutching unspent notes and huffing impatiently.\nJamie couldn’t remember when she’d started coming into {{pub}}, although he could remember what she was wearing the first time he saw her, floating blue shirt buttoned at the neck, a plait in her hair, snug jeans. It was {{dayofweek}} and he was wondering if it would be the same as every other day, serving her a flat white with soy milk, avoiding her eyes.\n“Hello? I hate to tell you how to do your job, but the idea is we tell you what we want and you get it for us?” the voice clanged into his reverie, he berated himself inwardly for falling into this trap once more, and issued a sincere apology to the customer. A steady day, a party of pensioners toasting a boule champion, a gaggle of new mums passing around cherubic infants. He caught the eye of one of the babies, felt himself pinned by an unashamed stare. He smiled and blew a raspberry. The baby gave a gummy grin. Jamie blushed with the sudden realisation that you always notice when someone’s watching you. Had she?\nBehind him, Dougie, who’d been a regular at {{pub}} since {{year minus 25 years}}, was chuckling along to the chat of Frank, the pub owner. “The phone’s bloody ringing off the hook, this morning I even get this guy asking me how I source my chives! Chives for god’s sake, he’s set up a whole business around it, he was telling me about the different fragrances, he was obsessed, all I could picture was him skipping around a green house full of them, his whole world all based around chives!”\nFrom across the pub, a voice: “Imogen, come back over here, you know I’ve told you not to run like that indoors.” She was still intent on her newspaper, she moved her hand to the back of her neck, massaged it gently. “Jamie? Jamie? I know you’re busy staring into space right now, but there’s a food order needs taking out when you’re ready.” “Sorry boss.”\nJamie collected the platter of deep fried snacks, thinking how she’d never order something like this. And he suddenly became aware that to get the food to its destination, he’d have to pass right by her table. The thought made him feel sick with anticipation and his hands, clutching the sides of the foil platter, erupted in sweat.\nMaybe this was the time to look at her for once, catch her eye, smile, roll his eyes at the tray of crisped up offerings. Rolling your eyes at snacks. I’m sure it would be irrestistible, he thought, annoyed with himself.\nHis deliberations proved wasted, as at the moment he passed the table, the voice came soaring across the pub again “IMOGEN! Come back here...” and a little figure darted in front of him, colliding with her table. The flat white she had been sipping tipped sideways in an almost neat way, spilling its milky contents onto the table and the floor.\nAnd then all of a sudden there was contact between them, an accidental arm-on-arm brush as they mopped the table, glances and smiles exchanged, chat about getting a new coffee. He strode over with it, trying to seem confident. She accepted it with a graceful nod, and when he hesitated before leaving the table, she glanced at the {{neighborhood}} news, the missing person’s headline emblazoned across it: Mark, 25, not seen for a month.\n“Terrible isn’t it? Seems so strange when people just vanish like that.”\nThe air around her was permeated by a delicate fragrance, not sweet, not sharp, just intoxicating.\n“I knew... I mean know him actually.” Jamie offered.\n“Oh really?” Her brow creased with concern. “Is he a close friend?”\n“Not really, but he worked in {{pub 2}} up the road, and so we used to chat a bit when I went in there, barman stuff.” He held back on the last chat they’d had, when Mark had been so enthralled by a regular customer. His eyes had been almost feverish when he’d talked of her, how things had been looking up at work, how there was a regular who he thought might be interested, how she was beautiful and enigmatic, how surely she wouldn’t be coming back if she didn’t like him?\nJamie was not unaware of the similarities with his own situation.\n“Oh, how terrible. I should have been more sensitive about bringing it up. I am sure he’ll turn up soon.” Her eyes were fixed on his, full of earnest concern. He nodded, feigning fragility to make her look for longer. And then the moment passed.\nShe sipped the drink. “Your flat whites are a dream. I’m tempted to hire you as a personal barista.”\n“I better get back to work.” He blurted, spinning on his heel so she didn’t see the burning in his cheeks.\nHe passed the table again after she’d left. And there it was, under the chair which almost seemed still fragrant with her presence, the canvas shopper she’d had slung over her shoulder when she entered. Inside a parcel, opened. It must be for her. This must be her address on the back.\nAt {{hours12}}{{ampm}} he was gathering his courage at the door of 21 {{museum street}}. Delivering the parcel by hand was a bold move, and he wasn’t really sure if his boss would approve of going to a customer’s house. But he needn’t know. He rang the bell, and resisted a sudden urge to leave the parcel and flee. A moment passed. Then, behind the door, he heard the gentle tapping of her feet.\nThe door swung open smoothly, and there she was. Her caramel coloured hair was draped over one shoulder and gleamed in the streetlight. She blinked, recognised him, saw the bag and then smiled widely.\n“Thank you so much! I am such an imbecile sometimes and I was convinced I’d left it on the bus.” Her face changed slightly, her gaze became more intense. “Come in? You’ve come all this way, have a cup of coffee? Mark isn’t it? I saw it on your name badge! Do come through to the lounge.”\nCrossing the threshold felt automatic. He would have done anything she asked. The door clicked shut behind him. Mark heard a key turn in the lock.","editkey":"Had she were concern heard","date":"1432944000","email":"\"\""}
{"_id":"55f41868d8e79e101900002d","author":"Fiona Shipwright","title":"Ideas above stations","text":"It was a {{dayofweek}} evening as I disembarked the train at {{train-station}}, getting on the train at that glass and metal canopy which has served so many different incarnations in a city which itself has also served so many different incarnations.\nI proceeded down from the tracks into the depths of the station, still keenly aware of the great differences between this terminal and, the nearby one at {{train-station 2}}, {{train-station 2 street}}.\n\nI was heading towards {{museum 1}}, and as the weather changed from {{weather}} to well, even more {{weather}}. I thought nothing of the fact that no one was seemed to be around. I was heading to the museum to meet with the curator about possibly working together in the future.\nI was allowing my powers of concentration to be temporarily taken over by a particularly absorbing playlist, chosen specifically for this {{weather}} weather, thereby allow a perfect little aestheticisation of my humble everyday experience. Recently I had given this mechanism - the ‘personal music video effect’ - and how it affected my perception of {{museum 1 city}} a lot of thought. Was it very different to my experience walking around {{forest}} last {{monthofyear}}? So engrossed was I in such thoughts that it was with a start that I realised a paper missile had just landed upon the pavement a few steps in front of me.\n\nI hadn’t caught anything in my peripheral vision and it seemed that could only have come from a great height. This seemed fairly unlikely but not entirely unreasonable in a city like {{museum 1 city}} given the average roof height.\n\nI picked up the paper, ready to swing round and hand it back in a hail of polite stammering to whoever had jettisoned it. But all was still. There was no one there. I looked around. This was a particularly in-between stretch of the city, a sort of non-place which bridged the areas of {{plaza 1}} and {{town-hall 1}} by means of vastly underused main road. Indeed, a funny place for the {{museum 1}} to even be located. With no claimants forthcoming I unscrunched the ball of paper. It was a map. In another story, I would perhaps be at the start of a grand tale involving curious quests and treasure chests. For this story however, nothing so pirate-esque. It was a transport map. One I had seen a thousand times before. But, curiously, it was covered in annotations and not entirely useful ones at first glance. There seemed to be nothing relating to a specific journey or station or line. There was in fact nothing noted around {{subway-station}} or the {{bus-line}}, both of which were\nnearby.\n\nThe artist, whoever they may be, seemed to have sketched something akin to a city-plan over the skeleton of the transport lines. But whilst it bore the same rough shape of {{city}} it was not an incarnation of the city that I recognised. Buildings such as the {{zoo}}, {{embassy}}, and {{airport}} did make an appearance, as did green spaces such as {{green-space}}, {{park}} and the {{lake}}, but these were all surrounded by clusters of much smaller structures. They seemed to be too small to be single houses, yet far too big to represent a crowd of people. A network of estuaries criss-crossed the map, broad enough to give the suggestion of motorways, yet if this were the case they were entirely inappropriate to the context. One broad artery began in {{neighborhood}}, sweeping across {{neighborhood 2}}, before finding what can only be described as an unsatisfactory end point in the depths of {{neighborhood 3}}.\n\nIt suddenly occurred to me that I had been standing in the {{weather}} staring at the map for quite some time. If anyone nearby did want to seize back ownership, they were either very shy or now very far away. Realising that it was nearly {{hours12}} and I was now late, I re-scrunched the piece of paper (it seemed quicker than folding it. Perhaps this is a fallacy), put it in my bag and carried on walking.\n\nA short while later I was greeted at the door of the museum by the curator. I opened my mouth to tell her of my strange discovery before something stopped me – I think I wanted to keep it to myself. I was so distracted by thoughts of my new, precious piece of paper that it took a few seconds to comprehend her panic-stricken expression. “I’m afraid we can’t meet today – I’m so sorry – but we discovered this afternoon that some articles from our collection have gone missing. From the maps and drawing archives. The programme I wanted to speak to you about. Well, it was a little, er, off-piste so to speak. Hence the challenges with funding I mentioned in my email.”\n\nI suddenly felt the walls of the {{art-gallery}} bearing down upon me. I shifted myself so that my bag felt very firmly anchored over on my shoulder. She had said nothing so far to indicate any connection with my recent cartographical discovery but in the past few minutes I had felt myself become fiercely protective of my contraband. She took a disproportionately deep breath and went on.\n\n“I guess I can tell you as you would have been told anyway. Though ideally that would have been after the non-disclosure agreement. Anyway. The {{museum 1 city}} senate released some files to us. They had their own attempted break in during {{monthofyear}} and got spooked. So they gave this ‘material’ to us. For safekeeping. The material is, well, how to say. It has been collected from police stations around the city, mainly from {{police-station}}. How to put this briefly - sometimes, when there is a case which remains open for years and years... well...sometimes those involved ask for some ‘alternative’ help.”\n\n‘Alternative’ help? At this point I was glad the meeting was no longer going ahead though wondered where this replacement impromptu one was going. I really wanted to get back to my flat, which given that it was on {{museum 1 street}}, was far enough away. Suddenly she threw her hands up to her face and spoke very quickly. “Sometimes people ask for, oh what do the police refer to them as, oh, ‘extra-sensory-practitioners’ to help find things and they do drawings and maps and lots of thinking and it sounds strange because it is but not that strange really well it depends and then after the attempt the senate thought people would find out and be outragde at the use of public funds so they gave the material to us. If you store them in an art gallery then well, perhaps they become ‘art’ and little less contentious.”\n\nIt took me a minute to diffuse my distraction and actually hear what she had just said. “I, er… wait, extra… do you mean psychics? You mean the police use psychics and they draw maps and you have some and now… wait, what?”. “Yes. And the {{museum}} really wanted to do an exhibition on illustration and communication over the years and we were struggling for donations for material and we thought well if we have these, why not use them somehow. Plus then the exhibition was due to travel to {{country}}, thereby solving the problem of embarrassment for the government. Taking them away. They would be framed as ‘outsider art’.” I was one third intrigued, one third embarrassed (I’m not even sure who far) with a final third comprising of mild offense and an ominous sense of foreboding. “What um, do these maps and drawings of {{museum 1 city}} look like?”\n\n“Well all sorts, but the collection that has gone missing - well they would have particularly nice in the exhibition. They’re drawn on top of subway maps.”","editkey":"fact that such lots the","date":"1432944000","email":"\"\"","key":"fiona"}

His place was just near the {{factory}}, but she got off early on {{factory street}} so she could get a four pack of Red Bull from {{beer-store}} and a refill for her e-cig. She'd been at Jake's last night after college with a few more of the guys and Nikki. {{#equals (weather) \"clear\"}}The afternoon had been clear and she'd broken her own vow and taken a drag on Nikki's fag- her friend the whole while explaining the nature of her crush on Jake.{{else}}Rain had pissed down until after it got dark so she and Nikki had made inky black coffee on Jake's Dad's espresso machine, her friend the whole while explaining the nature of her crush on Jake.{{/equals}}\n\nJasmine didn’t envy Nik her feelings and hoped her two mates would hook up- and soon, so she didn’t have to be sympathetic to Nikki’s scientific analysis of her own hormones anymore.\n\nSo there’d been nothing wrong with Jake on {{dayofweek minus 2 days}}, but today’s message had mentioned their final project, the only thing they talked about these days: ‘come over quick- my balloon has just flown us all from the field into a storm of shit xxx’.\n\nA couple of days ago the gang had all been hanging around the field with their drones. The drones were their project, were the culmination of their entire diploma really. They were friends because they were all doing the computer science course at {{University}}, all of them laughing at the name of the course on their first lesson. It was rare enough that anyone used the word 'computer' anymore anyway.\n\nThe field was just {{field}}, but they called it the field. Each machine was different. Jasmine's ran a subscription to the .gov land registry and took a snap and logged a grid ref every time it flew over a small patch of brownfield. Because of this hers was a classic quad-copter, up at forty meters relative and running a grid she'd set, knowing that the tallest buildings were over in {{supermarket city}}.\n\nNikki's on the other hand was a blimp type, dressed in those aggressive grey diagonals used by the navy in world war two. Hers had a rifle-mic that collected ambient sounds from wherever the lowest numbers of mobile phone pings were and stretched them into ambient music-tracks. Jake's was also a small blimp-type, an egg-blue envelope of helium with an infra-red camera and a nasty little algorithm that could run a wi-fi log check of the target’s phone and work out their identity with a 99% certainly based on data matching with other local collectors.\n\nHe’d called it the ‘fly-by-alibi’ but it was anything but. He’d wanted to sell it to the police if he could prove it worked by the end of term.\n\nIt was this, worried Jasmine, that had gotten Jake into trouble. Jas had run her test and gone home after an hour- walking home in the dark. Jake and Nikki though had left their rigs up to extend their search areas and gone to {{burger-joint}} together.\n\nJasmine paid for her stimulants and absently left the shop- she’d forgotten her change but the pavement of {{burger-joint 2}} held her attention now as the cracks became search-pattern vectors in her sleep-starved mind. Had Jake run his drone into {{golf-course}} and started a fire?\n\nIn the end it was nothing like that. Jake's was a fairly typical suburban street: narrow houses of brick with white plastic and a roof of concrete tiles. Tatty front gardens of patchy grass, all the front doors different colours but the same in their shared reach for individuality. She knew she didn't need to ring the bell, her RFID unlocked the door as she reached it. She headed straight upstairs past the front room where the fug of smoke showed where Jake's elders insisted on ending their lives with actual tobacco. Jakes bedroom door was a little different.\n\nJake Sat her down in front of her own monitor: she was being shown video from the other night, it was all in the shitty pixelated-blue of low infrared. Data scrolled letting her know that this was from 02:24 the morning after the {{dayofweek minus 2 days}} night on the field. Suddenly a cluster of orange blobs appeared on the screen, hot bodies. She couldn’t see exactly how many, but it was at least four. The POV was high and drifted sideway, she assumed as Jake, operating from his table in the diner, had cut the motors so as not to alert the people below. A cursor whipped across the screen, pulling up menus, this was obviously a recording direct from the feed of Jake’s phone. Four boxes and then a fifth popped into view, code blurred past then coalesced even as the drone’s-eye-view span and Jas could clearly make out five figures, one of which was distinctly feminine. Names and probabilities now floated next to each person. The four men she didn’t know but ‘Daniels, Stephanie: 98%’\nwas clear enough. Jakes camera had caught {{burger-joint city}}’s MP meeting in the dead of night.\n\nThe figures were moving, something was exchanged and a large cool mass was moved from the rear of a van and carried by two of the men to the open boot of a car, overseen by the other pair of heavies. The woman shook hands with both men, climbed into the car to be followed by one man. The van turned and was moving out of frame when the view expanded. Jake had gained some height to keep it in, and see which way the van went. The noise though seemed to have alerted the last man. He turned and looked directly up at the camera. He raised his arm and pointed a hot object at her. Nothing happened. After a little while the man regarded the object he’d aimed, turned for the car and got in the drivers seat. It sat for a while, the seeping heat through the bonnet showing the engine running before it too backed away and headed down the road the opposite way to the van. The feed ended. She turned back to Jake.\n\n‘Who were the other two men?’\n\n‘The one’s with the van?’\n\n‘Yes’\n\n'I ran a search, the big one's been arrested several times for assault, but he's an ex-soldier, served in the war in Romania. The other one used to work in the museum mines in and is now a lecturer.' He paused. 'A lecturer in commercial explosives. That kind of gives you idea of what I've got us into.'\n\n'What do you mean?'\n\n'Well, this wouldn't be a problem if I hadn't been tagged. We didn't witness any crime as such, but you saw it's as dodgy as fuck and you can bet they'll come after us'\n\n'Tagged?'\n\n'That guy who pointed his phone at my drone was running software similar to mine, I didn’t mask my IP.’\n\n'Why have you left it two days then, and why are you still here!?'\n\n'Because of this' he tapped something and gestured toward the monitor. Jasmine turned back to look and read the email displayed.\n\n“Share any information you have from that night and they’ll be a house-fire at your address We’ll be making a visit to yours in two days.”\n\nDownstairs the bell rang.","editkey":"if end figures woman search","date":"1432944000","email":"\"\""}
